<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Took interest in the fintech sector some months ago, specifically on the emerging area of fractional investments. Looking to start up a company for the same, thus took the opportunity to build a base version of the website/application with intention to further develop it into a working site.
